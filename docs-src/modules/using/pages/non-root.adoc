= Using JICMP as non-root

JICMP normally uses raw sockets, which requires root access on some operating systems.

== Mac OS X

Mac OS X supports non-root ICMP through the $$SOCK_DGRAM$$ interface, which JICMP uses by default if it is found.

== Linux

On Linux, you must set a `sysctl` `OID` to allow ping from non-root users.

To do so, specify a range of `gid` values that are allowed to send non-root. 
The examples below use `429496729` because it is the highest possible `gid` value, but we recommend that you specify the `gid` of the user that OpenNMS will run as instead.
This limits the number of accounts allowed to access raw sockets on the system.

To do so, run the following:

[source, shell]
----
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 429496729"
----

To permanently configure it on bootup, create a configuration file in `/etc/sysctl.d`:

[source, shell]
----
echo "net.ipv4.ping_group_range=0 429496729" > /etc/sysctl.d/03-non-root-icmp.conf
----
