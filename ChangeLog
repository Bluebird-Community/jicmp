1.0.10
------
* Solaris 64-bit build fixes
* A few minor build-system tweaks

1.0.9
-----
* major Win32 fixes, including a bug that would cause exceptions if you
  start attempting to receive packets before the first is sent
* support for building on Win64 (use the java.io.FileDescriptor's 'handle'
  rather than 'fd', since SOCKETs on Windows are a native HANDLE type)
* minor build-system cleanup; CMake still only works with visual studio on
  Win32 right now; for MinGW use MSYS and autoconf

1.0.8
-----
* build system cleanups
* minor Win32 fixes

1.0.7
-----
* implement CMake for easier portability

1.0.6
-----
* fix build-system (missing check for ip.h)
* fix build on Mac OS X

1.0.5
-----
* builds on windows
* other build-system cleanups

1.0.4
-----
* re-generate tarball, autoconf issues  :(

1.0.3
-----
* updated header detection to work on FreeBSD 6.x (in_systm.h needs to be
  detected before ip.h)

1.0.2
-----

* changed sprintf calls to snprintf to fix potential errno overflow issues
* fixed build with Sun CC (if you need to build 64-bit binaries, you will
  need to set -xarch manually in your CFLAGS)
* fixed detection of some system headers
* builds with gcj
